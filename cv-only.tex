% Items in this appendix would normally include copies of papers, but could also include copies of proposal abstracts, letters of research awards, or letters of notification of honors, such as outstanding paper awards. If the list of research activities called for in "Research and Scholarly Activities" (Section III) is extensive, it could be included here and referred to in that section.

% \subsection*{Supporting Documentation for Service Activities}
% Items included here could be letters of commendation, copies of service reports authored by the candidate, or more detailed descriptions of service than is possible in "Service Activities" (Section IV).

% \subsection*{Supporting Documentation for Professional Practice}
% Items included here might include notification of professional registration, letters of commendation for consulting or clinical practice, or syllabi and manuals developed for short-courses, workshop or conferences.

% \subsection*{Department Head Letter of Nomination}
% This appendix will contain two important letters:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item A brief letter from the candidate addressed to the department head/program chair that states "This letter certifies that I have reviewed my dossier and that the entries and substantiation thereof are accurate."
% \item A letter from the department head/program chair nominating the candidate for promotion. The letter should state the degree of support for the nomination in the department/program. For promotion to full professor, identifying the support of the department’s/program’s full professors is important. Copies of the faculty member’s annual goal/performance evaluations for the past three years could be included in this appendix.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection*{Letters of Recommendation from Outside Reviewers}
% Include a brief statement of the credentials of each person from whom letters have been solicited. It is expected that for promotion to full (associate) professor at least five (three) letters will be solicited. Include what aspect of the candidate’s performance the referee is competent to judge and why. Include all letters received. These letters should be added to the dossier by the department head/program chair after the candidate has made his/her final review of the dossier to afford the recommender’s confidentiality.

% The academic unit head should write all requests for evaluations. The candidate should not solicit these letters although s/he may suggest names of references. The letters of request should clearly state what kind of an evaluation is being sought (the factors to be evaluated, the rank for which the person is being recommended and other pertinent information). Wherever reasonable, one or both of the following questions should be asked. From what you know of this person, would you recommend him/her for promotion at your institution?

% Where does the candidate rank among his/her peers? As a courtesy to those being asked to write letters, a current copy of the candidate’s résumé should be sent.
